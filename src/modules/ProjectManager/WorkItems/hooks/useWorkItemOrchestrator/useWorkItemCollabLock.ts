/**
 * Cloud execution-lock awareness for the work item orchestrator
 * (design §16.6 / §16.9, cloud-parity Phase B/E).
 *
 * A shared work item is a native local row under a CLOUD-aliased project org
 * (`external_org_id` alias). This hook resolves whether the CURRENT work
 * item belongs to such an org and, if so, who holds the server-arbitrated
 * execution lock so the "start agent" affordance can disable instead of
 * double-starting.
 *
 * The lock itself is arbitrated by the server RPCs (cloudWorkItemLock.ts);
 * the holder (`executionLock.lockedByMemberId` — a cloud userId) syncs down
 * inside the work-item payload, so read paths stay purely local.
